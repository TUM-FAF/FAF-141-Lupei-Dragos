What I did?
--------------------
•Created a Windows application similiar to paint.

•I added the possibility to draw a line, rectangle, circle , bezier curves using mouse.

•Created a drawing area where you can:

To choose with which color you want to draw

Change thickness of the line

Filling with color objects depending on what are you drawing

Erase what you drew.

•Added a custom Bitmap Image in the left bottom corner

•I hooked 2 keyboard inputs. 
One is when you press on Ctrl+Space your mouse will be transformed in to an eraser
and when you press on Alt+C you will draw circles.
